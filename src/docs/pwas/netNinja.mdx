PWAs enable native functionality without needing to learn native code  
Creates an app-like feel - they are loaded via the browser but feel and perform like native apps  
They are built using HTML CSS and JS only  
They are accessed via a web address, you don't need to go to the app/play store  
They can access device features like camera, GPS etc  
They can also be used offline  
They can deliver push notifications

Lesson covers starter project set up - basic code, including CSS and JS, as well
as CSS framework (Materialize) Uses 'live Server' to view/test results in
browser

Web App Manifest file is essential for a PWA - Will hold key info, including
logo image and name Adds

Manifest.json - in root By adding “display - standalone” it will not include browser bar - key to app look and feel  
Includes lots if different icon sizes to be used by different browsers and systems  
These icons are listed in the manifest  
Link the index.html file to the manifest file (in head), as you would a CSS stylesheet

Android Studio is used to run emulated tests This lesson runs through process of
loading an emulator device for testing  
Explains the way to get localhost showing
on a separated emulated device, via 10.0.2.2:5500  
At this stage I loaded repo
onto a Netlify server, and tested on iphone - I was able to add to homescreen
successfully  
Without Service Workers, user needs to add the page to their
homescreen manually  
SWs will eventually enable an option (for adding to home
screen) to be preented to user

### Net-Ninja PWA Lesson 5 - IOS Support

An additional step is needed to display icons on an iPhone (default is to use an
automated screenshot).  
Observation - it is very easy to create the homescreen
element on a phone, which is a large part of the app process

### Net-Ninja PWA Lesson 6 - Service Workers

SWs allow you to load content offline.  
They also enable background sync - e.g. allows for an online-only action (like a status update) to be cached offline and
pushed through when a connection is established.  
Push notifications - e.g. reminders SWs, are just js files, but run on a different thread to normal browser
js files - they cannot access the DOM.  
They run in the background, but they react to events happening in the browser: push, fetch etc.

### Net-Ninja PWA Lesson 7 - Service Worker Lifecycle

Scope is important to SWs, they need to be in root to access root files.  
App.js has the task of informing the browser that sw.js should be seen as a SW, and
allocated its own SW thread.  
When registered by the browser, there is an
‘install event’.  
Once registered, a SW will not be replaced when the browser
reloads the page.  
Once registered, the SW becomes ‘Active’. At this stage it can detect when something has changed, and can listen to get / post events.
