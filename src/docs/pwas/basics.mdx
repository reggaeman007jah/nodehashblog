## PWA Notes

PWA: Progressive web App

Behaves in a similar way to native apps, but does not require downloading from app or play store.

PWAs are websites that create icons on your homescreen, on both your desktop and mobile phone.

They can - to a degree - operate offline.

Fast / Integrated / Reliable / User Engagement

Fast - speed is similar to mobile apps, even though they are essentially browser-based elements.

Reliable - is should work offline

UX - web push means it is always up to date (push even when browser is off)

Service Workers are key to these capabilities by caching data - this enables some functionality even while offline.

Service workers also handle push notifications, and enable access to phone components like camera.

A SW is just a script that runs in the background.

You run a check first, in order to see if the browser understands SWs

You can see whether they are working by looking in teh dev tools

Workbox is a library that manages SWs for you.

Goal is not to get users to download an app, it is to get them to use your service

Not all devices support service workers

HTTPS is a key component to PWAs (i.e. the green lock)

The green lock tells the user your site/service is secure, data is being sent confidentially, and that no one is listening.

PWAs can be created over time (progressively)

PWAs also us the Web App Manifest - this simple JSON file holds key info for each page in your app

You need this element to enable your site to be shown on a mobile screen, just like a normal app

As this is delivered outside of the app/play stores, there is no costs payable to those services

This works on a single codebase, so no native code needed. This works on all devices (relatively) equally.

Perf SEO etc is assessed by Google Lighthouse - this is a guide to how close you are to having a PWA

At its core, a PWA needs only 4 files:
index.html
logo.png
manifest.JSON
service-worker.js

This theme is a great and complete option to build simple documentation websites.
We don't plan anymore to include search, dark mode or i18n to the project.

Remember that if necessary, you can change colors and include a default
dark theme. To do so, check this [doc](/usage/shadowing#changing-theme-colors).

## How can I deploy my website?

To deploy this project, we recommend you take a look at this extensive documentation
hosted on [Gatsby website](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/deploying-and-hosting/). It
includes deploy tutorials for many services, like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/),
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and others.
