Progressive Web Apps - General Notes

Mobile apps are rarely downloaded onto devices - reach is poor, but usage is high  
Websites have much better reach but suffer from performance and lack of app-feel  
PWAs attempt to bring together best of both worlds - easy reach + app-like performance

At its core, a PWA needs only 4 files:  
index.html  
logo.png  
manifest.JSON  
service-worker.js

They behave in a similar way to native apps, but do not require downloading from app/play store (note, no store fees).  
PWAs are websites that can also create icons on your homescreen, on both your desktop and mobile phone.  
They can - to a degree - operate offline, depending on your caching strategy.  
Fast / Integrated / Reliable / User Engagement.  
 Fast - speed is similar to mobile apps, even though they are essentially browser-based elements.  
 Integrated - they allow access to device APIs like camera and GPS.  
 Reliable - it should work offline.  
 User Engagement - web push means it is always up to date (can push even when browser is off).  
Service Workers are key to these capabilities by caching data - this enables offline functionality.  
Service workers also handle push notifications, and enable access to phone components like camera.  
An SW is just a script that runs in the background.  
They can be inspected using the standard Chroms dev tools.  
It is single-threaded, but does not operate on the DOM thread, rather, it hs its own thread.  
Not all devices support service workers, so one should always check (via code) that the client browser can process / understand SWs.  
Libraries can be used to manage SWs, e.g. workbox.  
HTTPS is a key component to PWAs (i.e. the green lock) - localhost is an exception for development.  
The green lock tells the user your site/service is secure, data is being sent confidentially, and that no one is listening.  
PWAs can be created over time (i.e. progressively).  
PWAs also use the 'Web App Manifest' - a simple JSON file that holds key info for each page in your app.  
You need this element to enable your site to be shown on a mobile screen, just like a normal app.  
This solution works on a single codebase, so no native code is needed.  
I.e. it works on all devices (relatively) equally.  
Google Lighthouse has tools to track your step-progression to achieving PWA status.
