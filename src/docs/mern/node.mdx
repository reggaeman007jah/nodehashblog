Express is a framework, making node servers and services (much) easier to
implement  
Manages server-side logic, routing, responses etc  
Makes code earlier to read - although not essential (node native will do the same thing)  
Create an app.js to manage the express server  
Import relevant elements, and set up a listener (on a port)  
Then add paths (/, /about etc)  
Each route has a req and res element  
So each route has an instruction for each GET request, e.g. res.send  
Express will assume status codes and content-type here, which is helpful  
By adding different GET handlers, you can add new pages  
If you have pages as separate html files, you can call those in your responses - res.sendFile + path
.. but needs a second param that confirms the root of the project, so the path
makes sense.  
Adds nav elements to link between pages  
Redirects are managed via res.redirect + new path (also sets status code)  
Then create 404 page, via app.use  
By placing at the end (bottom) of the file, it only triggers if the code reaches that point, so is in effect a catch-all for anything not routed
beforehand
Here we need to manually add the 404 status code.
